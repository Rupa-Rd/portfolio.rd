## [(issue #1199)](https://github.com/swapnilsparsh/30DaysOfJavaScript/issues/1199)

<p>
<strong>Problem:</strong> 
The website (https://30daysofjs.netlify.app/) showcases numerous JavaScript projects, but lacks clear explanations for each one. Users must visit individual GitHub repositories to understand their purpose, which is time-consuming and cumbersome.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> 
Implement project descriptions directly on the website. When a user hovers their mouse over a project name, a concise description appears on top of a slightly faded image. This allows users to quickly grasp project functionalities without leaving the website.
</p>

## [(issue #50)](https://github.com/CSEdgeOfficial/learn.csedge.courses/issues/50)

<p>
<strong>Problem:</strong>
The current blog page lacks a clear title or has it positioned below the cover image, making it difficult for users to identify the specific blog they're reading.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Proposed Solution:</strong>
<br/>
<strong>Ensure All Blogs Have Titles:</strong> Every blog post should have a designated title that accurately reflects its content.
<strong>Prominent Title Placement:</strong> Position the blog title above the cover image. This placement offers immediate clarity and aligns with user expectations for title location.<br/>
<strong>Title Emphasis:</strong> Consider increasing the font size or using a bolder font for the title to enhance its visual prominence on the page. This step is optional but can further improve readability.

## [(issue #5469)](https://github.com/codinasion/codinasion/pull/5510)

<p>
<strong>Problem:</strong>
The description outlines the need for a Java program to convert between standard date formats and Julian dates. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Proposed Solution:</strong>
Develop the Java program that takes a standard date format (e.g., "YYYY-MM-DD") as input and calculates the corresponding Julian date (YYYYDDD). Conversely, the program should also accept a Julian date and convert it back to the standard format.
